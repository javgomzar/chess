# Chess

This is a personal project, an app to play chess coded in Python. Currently there is only one mode of playing, controlling both the white and the black players. 

Clone this project running `git clone https://github.com/javgomzar/chess.git` on your command prompt in the local directory of your preference. Then run `py main.py` to get the app running. Be aware that the app uses Unicode characters to represent the chess pieces so you will need to be using a font with full Unicode support in your shell (sometimes the default fonts don't have full Unicode support).
