# Chess

This is a personal project, an app to play chess coded in Python. Currently there is only one mode of playing, controlling both the white and the black players. 

There are two ways to run the app:
- Clone this project running `git clone https://github.com/javgomzar/chess.git` on your command prompt in the local directory of your preference. Then run `py main.py` to get the app running. Be aware that the app uses Unicode characters to represent the chess pieces so you will need to be using a font with full Unicode support in your shell (sometimes the default fonts don't have full Unicode support).
- Go to the file `interactive_notebook.ipynb` in this repository. There you will find a Jupyter notebook with which you can interact online without the need of downloading the code.
